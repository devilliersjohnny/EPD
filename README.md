### 2. Preparing our system

<b>Getting the ENVIRONMENT ready</b>

This integration relies heavily on the environment variables within <b>Home Assistant</b> (HA) which in turn relies heavily on the variables from the <b>Operating System</b> (OS) therefore in order to use this effectively we need to ensure that we have configured the systems' timezone, date and network.

Thereafter it relies quite heavily on the cards and integrations from the <b>HACS</b> repositories... that said `THANK YOU` to all of the giants that have gone about creating this environment, the folks from <b>Home Assistant</b>, those from the <b>HACS</b> integration and those who created the <b>wonderful repositories</b> and made them available for our use! In the section just below  we will go about configuring the `HACS` integration and then in no particular order the initial setup of the `Integrations` and `Cards`

### HACS

There are already plenty of videos showing how to install HACS out there and again in no particular order other than searching `Install HACS 2024` on `Google` here are the first 5 links to `Youtube` Videos showing you how to do so
